# Swift Raspberry Video Streaming
Streaming video from Raspberry Pi Camera directly to web browser or to ios mobile device. I reduced frame rates to minimise latency on the client. Ideal to use in UAV projects.

# Installation
See http://headstation.com/archives/streaming-video-using-pi-camera/ for detailed instructions on how to setup the Raspberry using motion. Clone or download this repo to get super basic swift interface to the Raspberry video stream.
